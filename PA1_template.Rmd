## Loading and preprocessing the data

The first thing to do is to load the libraries that we will need for data manipulation and graphs: in this case dplyr and ggplot2.  
We read the csv provided for this assignment through a read.csv, indicating also the presence of header and NA.
We then modify the "date" variable imported as a character in date.

```{R, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
dati = read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")
dati$date = as.Date(as.character(dati$date))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
